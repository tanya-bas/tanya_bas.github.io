# Hi! I am Tanya


I am an ML researcher interested in LLM GNN intersection, coding models and agents, AI safety (mechanistic interpretability and alignment). I like playing around with different architectures and implementing things from scratch. 

I was fascinated about the logical structures of language and language models before it became mainstream. I have learnt 6 languages and it gave me a unique perspective on language as a concept. 

I lived studied and worked in 🇺🇸 🇬🇧 🇺🇦 🇹🇼 🇰🇷 🇮🇳 🇨🇦 🇩🇪

I also run (marathon PB 3:14, half marathon PB 1:24) in my free time

### Large-Scale Gender Bias Analysis in Language Models *(under peer review)*
Engineered a framework for generating new benchmarking datasets anchoring them in the social science studies. Expanded dataset diversity 5x for gender bias detection in LLMs.  
Implemented a forced-choice, zero-shot classification method by comparing the log-likelihoods of each candidate label and KL divergence for alignment assessment.

### SeizureSavvy
Researched state-of-the-art models for seizure forecasting, implemented an LSTM model achieving 84% prediction accuracy. Deployed XGBoost to identify and rank top seizure triggers, providing actionable insights for patient care. Designed the database schema and data pipeline to collect, store, and analyze patient-reported symptoms and episodes.

### OCR Data Scarcity
Built a handwritten character recognition system (CNN) for use cases with data scarcity. Used conditional variational autoencoders (CVAE) and GANs to overcome data scarcity, manually creating a custom dataset. Combined CVAE for latent space manipulation and GAN architectures with progressive upsampling to generate synthetic training samples.

### Road Traffic Network Simulation for Data-Driven Urban Planning
Designed a traffic congestion simulation using OSMnx and NetworkX with 73% alignment with historical traffic congestion data, comparing Berlin and San Francisco road networks through dynamic car movement and density-based jam detection. Created a theoretical model using graph theory for analytical estimations of traffic dynamics, utilizing edge betweenness centrality to predict congestion patterns and validate against empirical simulation results.

### ForestFire Spread
Developed a forest fire simulation in British Columbia using environmental factors (wind, density, temperature, humidity). Designed and evaluated 3 fire mitigation strategies demonstrating that random firebreaks reduced forest burn percentage by 50% compared to targeted high-risk area interventions. Conducted percolation analysis and theoretical modeling using renormalization group theory to derive mathematical relationships between wind strength and fire spread probability, validating empirical results against theoretical predictions.

### Bayesian Modeling for UK GP Visit Estimations
Developed complete pooling and partial pooling Zero-Inflated Poisson models with PyMC to estimate missing values of average GP visits across geographical regions, and age groups in the UK. Performed model comparison using PSIS leave-one-out cross-validation.
